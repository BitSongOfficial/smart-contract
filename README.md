## Token Standards
Opus token is compliant to the [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) standards.

## The first decentralized music streaming platform
**BitSong** is a new *music platform*, which will be built using the **Ethereum** blockchain and the **IPFS** distribuited filesystem.

**BitSong** is a project dedicated to **musicians** and **listeners**, to solve one of the major problems related to the world of music. Problems that a musician who wants to emerge knows very well.

From today **you will be producing your song**, the advertiser will upload his advertisement and the user will listen to the songs **from any device**. For each advertisement listened, the artist and the listener will get up to 90% of the profits invested by the advertiser. You can also receive donations from your fans for your next album.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a new brand linked to music streaming, but unlike other platforms, **BitSong will earn both, the artist, the user** the user who listens to the song and finally will also make save money **the advertiser**.

Our goal is to be present on any TV equipped with **Chromecast or SmartTV**, on any **Smartphone** through **App**, on any personal computer through a **web interface** or software and finally on any car that has a **Smart Radio**.
